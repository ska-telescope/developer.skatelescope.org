SKA telescope developer portal
------------------------------

Welcome to the `Square Kilometre Array <http://www.skatelescope.org>`_ software
documentation portal. Whether you are a developer involved in SKA or you are
simply one of our many users, all of our software processes and projects are
documented or linked to in this portal.

The portal is frequently updated as the project evolves; if you feel that something is missing, please have a look at our :doc:`guide to contributing to the developer portal </contributor/contribute>`

If you're new to developing the SKA, please have a look at :doc:`our Onboarding material </getting-started/getting-started>` and the :doc:`guideance on setting up your development environment </getting-started/devenv-setup>`.

.. note::
   Please also read the :doc:`/policies/code-of-conduct`, which governs all SKA interactions.

What follows is a brief guide to the headings you'll find in the left-hand sidebar of this site. Feel free to explore!
