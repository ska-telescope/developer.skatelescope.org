SRCNet Software Stack
=====================

This project details the software stack that underpins the SRCNet platform.
The software stack refers to the various software subsystems that work 
together to enable SRCNet functionality. These subsystems can be broadly 
categorized into local services that run on individual nodes, optional 
services that can be deployed on nodes, and global services that run 
centrally. The following sections detail each of the software components 
in each category and their specific deployment.
