List of projects and subgroups
------------------------------

The majority of the SKA projects are currently housed at the root of our gitlab organisation repository at [https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope] but the SKA encourages the use of Gitlab subgroups to house closely related repositories. The following lists of projects are automatically extracted from our gitlab organisation repository
at [https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope] 

Subgroups: Science Data Challenges, Software Defined Infrastructure, templates.
