Processing Scripts
++++++++++++++++++

The processing scripts define the processing to be done by SDP to generate the
data products. They express the high-level organisation of the processing,
which is carried out by execution engines and processing functions. Details of
the real-time and batch scripts, and instructions on how to develop a script
can be found here.

Processing Scripting Library
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The processing scripting library is a high-level interface for writing
processing scripts. Its goal is to provide abstractions to enable the developer
to define a script without needing to interact directly with the low-level
interfaces such as the configuration library.
