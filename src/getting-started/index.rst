Getting Started and the SKA Developer Community
-----------------------------------------------

This section is about getting you up and running. It contains the onboarding material for all new SKA developers, the general contribution guidelines when working on SKA projects, guidance on setting up your development environment, and a list of projects, so you know what the SKA is working on. There is also a wealth of information about our development tools and practices, which you can read as you start development work.
