General purpose development
===========================

Configuring your development environment depends on the type of development you want to do.

Container based development is the recommended way to develop when possible, but situations might arise where
you need to develop locally or remotely over an ssh connection to a headless machine.

We go through those three scenarios in the following sections and suggest the users to follow them in the order they are presented.
