****************************************
Configuring your development environment
****************************************

Configuring your development environment depends on the type of development you want to do.

Container based development is the recommended way to develop when possible, but situations might arise where
you need to develop locally or remotely over an ssh connection to an headless machine.

We go throtugh those three scenarios in the following sections and sugest you to start in the order they are presented.

1. :doc:`Setup local development environment</getting-started/devenv-setup/local-development>`
2. :doc:`Development using containers</getting-started/devenv-setup/container-development/container-development>`
3. Remote development over ssh
