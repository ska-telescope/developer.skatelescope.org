Software Development Security Policy
************************************

Most of the software used for the control and operation of the SKAO telescopes will be developed by SKA Community members and contributors. 
To ensure the smooth operation of the SKAO and minimise the risk of software vulnerabilities, information security must be incorporated 
within the software development lifecycle of SKAO software. This document describes how this must be achieved. 

The canonical copy of this information is `available in ALIM as \"ISMS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SECURITY POLICY\" SKA-GOV-0000017 <https://ska-aw.bentley.com/SKAProd/Search/QuickLink.aspx?n=SKA-GOV-0000017&t=3&d=Main%5ceB_PROD&sc=Global&r=01&i=view>`_ .
