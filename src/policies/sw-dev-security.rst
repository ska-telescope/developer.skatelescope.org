Software Development Security Policy
************************************

Most of the software used for the control and operation of the SKAO telescopes will be developed by SKA Community members and contributors. 
To ensure the smooth operation of the SKAO and minimise the risk of software vulnerabilities, information security must be incorporated 
within the software development lifecycle of SKAO software. This document describes how this must be achieved. 

A first draft of the document: ISMS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SECURITY POLICY SKA-GOV-0000017 
is `available in the Solution Intent google drive <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNIeiy_h7p2z9kDPZZfewlwHy5SYwabE/view?usp=sharing>`_.
