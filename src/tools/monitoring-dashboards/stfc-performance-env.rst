STFC cluster
*****************

Cluster specs
=============
.. image:: ../images/cluster.png
  :alt: Rack diagram: whole cluster has Compute:232C/464T, Memory:2.5TB RAM, SSD: 21.76TB, HDD: 33.60TB, 10GB top of rack switch with redundancy. Two compute node types: one with 512GB RAM, the other with 128GB RAM, both with 2x Intel Xeon E5-2650 chips and 2x 400GB SSD in RAID 0, and 2x 10GB and 2x 1GB links. One Controller node with redundancy, with 64GB RAM and 4x 600GB SAS in RAID 4, with the same links as the compute nodes. Two flavours of storage node: SSD and SAS.

Access the cluster
==================
The STFC cluster is located at the SKAO headquarters, UK. To have access to the cluster, it is required
to be inside the facilities or have VPN credentials to access the IT network
remotely.

Access to the network using VPN
===============================
At the moment, VPN credentials are sent individually and can be requested by sending an
email or Slack message on `#team-system-support <https://skao.slack.com/archives/CEMF9HXUZ>`_ channel for System Team specific services.

Access to the OpenStack platform (Virtualization)
=================================================
.. image:: ../images/openstack-login.png
  :alt: Openstack login dialog box. Dialog boxes are labelled in Portuguese.

The OpenStack platform requires authentication in order to use it.

At the moment, OpenStack credentials are sent individually and it is required
to send an email to  Domingos Nunes (dfsn@ua.pt) with the knowledge from Piers
Harding (piers@ompka.net). In the next phase, OpenStack could support Gitlab
authentication.

To access the OpenStack platform go to http://192.168.93.215/dashboard
(requires VPN) and login with your credentials. These credentials should be
the same used for your VPN authentication. The **Domain** to use is
**default**.

Virtual machine deployment
--------------------------
- At the sidebar, go to Project -> Compute -> Instances and click on the "Launch Instance" button:

.. image:: ../images/openstack-project-compute-instance.png
  :alt: OpenStack Horizon interface, with the left-hand sidebar highlighted, and the "Launch Instance" button highlighted in blue.

- At this stage a menu will pop-up and will ask to specify virtual machine characteristics, chose an name for virtual machine:

.. image:: ../images/openstack-vm-chars.png
  :alt: OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box

- Select the Operating System you want your VM to have:

**NOTE: Please choose the option "Yes" at "Delete Volume on Instance Delete"
so when you decide to delete the instance the volume will be also deleted and
not occupy unnecessary space**

.. image:: ../images/openstack-vm-os.png
   :alt: OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box, on the Source tab, highlighting in red the Delete Volume on Instance Delete buttons.

.. image:: ../images/openstack-vm-os2.png
  :alt: Openstack Launch Instance dialog box, on the Source tab, showing the Delete Volume on Instance Delete button set to Yes, and the CentOS7 OS allocated.

- Select the flavor which you want your VM to have:

.. image:: ../images/openstack-flavor.png
  :alt: OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box, showing the Flavor tab

.. image:: ../images/openstack-flavor2.png
  :alt: OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box, showing the Flavor tab, with a Flavor selected.

- Select private network (int-net):

.. image:: ../images/openstack-network.png
  :alt: OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box, showing the Networks tab

.. image:: ../images/openstack-network2.png
  :alt: OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box, showing the int_net network selected.

- Create or use ssh key to enable ssh access to the VM:

.. image:: ../images/openstack-sshkeys.png
  :alt:  OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box, showing the Key Pair tab

- In the end press on "Launch Instance" button at the bottom. This initiates the virtual machine deployment. It could take a while:

.. image:: ../images/openstack-launch-instance.png
  :alt: OpenStack Launch Instance dialog box, with the "Launch Instance" button highlighted in red.

- When the Power State become "Running", the virtual machine has been successfully deployed and is ready to be used:

.. image:: ../images/openstack-running-intance.png
  :alt: OpenStack Instances tab, showing the newly-created instance

- Since the VM is deployed inside private network you will need to associate Floating IP from your network have the access:

.. image:: ../images/openstack-running-intance.png
  :alt: OpenStack Instances tab, showing the newly-created instance, with the dropdown box to the right of the instance status line highlighted

.. image:: ../images/openstack-floating-choose.png
  :alt: OpenStack instance dropdown, with the "Associate Floating IP" option highlighted in red

.. image:: ../images/openstack-floating-add.png
  :alt: OpenStack Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box

.. image:: ../images/openstack-floating-add2.png
  :alt: OpenStack Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box with all options selected. The "Associate" button is highlighted in red

.. image:: ../images/openstack-floating-ip.png
  :alt: OpenStack Instances tab, highlighting with red underline the newly-associated IP address.

- Now using any SSH client connect to the instance through VPN using the Floating IP address. The login user is **ubuntu** when using the Ubuntu base images and **centos** for the CentOS ones.

Docker machine deployment
-------------------------
Official docker-machine documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/

1. Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Guide: https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/

2. Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to use the OpenStack integration you need to export OpenStack
Authentication credentials.

For the future use, create an executable file which will export environmental
variables automatically. For example you can call file "openstackrc" and the
content of the file be:

::

	# VM CONFIG
	export OS_SSH_USER=ubuntu
	export OS_IMAGE_NAME=Ubuntu1604
	export OS_FLAVOR_NAME=m1.medium
	export OS_FLOATINGIP_POOL=ext_net
	export OS_SECURITY_GROUPS=default
	export OS_NETWORK_NAME=int_net

	# AUTH
	export OS_DOMAIN_NAME=default
	export OS_USERNAME=<OPENSTACK_USER>
	export OS_PASSWORD=<OPENSTACK_PASS>
	export OS_TENANT_NAME=geral
	export OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.93.215:5000/v3


OS_SSH_USER
  Default ssh user, usually it is ubuntu (if operating system is ubuntu)

OS_IMAGE_NAME

3. Usage
^^^^^^^^

**Complete documentation about docker-machine CLI commands can be found here:
https://docs.docker.com/machine/reference/**

3.1 Run the enviromental variable file
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
::

	$ . openstackrc

3.2 Create docker-machine
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Create a machine. Requires the --driver flag to indicate which provider
(OpenStack) the machine should be created on, and an argument to indicate the
name of the created machine.

::

	$ docker-machine create --driver=openstack MACHINE-NAME

	Creating CA: /root/.docker/machine/certs/ca.pem
	Creating client certificate: /root/.docker/machine/certs/cert.pem
	Running pre-create checks...
	Creating machine...
	(MACHINE-NAME) Creating machine...
	Waiting for machine to be running, this may take a few minutes...
	Detecting operating system of created instance...
	Waiting for SSH to be available...
	Detecting the provisioner...
	Provisioning with ubuntu(systemd)...
	Installing Docker...
	Copying certs to the local machine directory...
	Copying certs to the remote machine...
	Setting Docker configuration on the remote daemon...
	Checking connection to Docker...
	Docker is up and running!
	To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on
	this virtual machine, run: docker-machine env MACHINE-NAME

In this step docker-machine will create VM inside OpenStack. As soon as the
ssh connection to VM is available the Docker service will be installed.

3.3 Set docker-machine environment
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Set environment variables to dictate that docker should run a command against
a particular machine.
::

	$ docker-machine env MACHINE-NAME

	export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/root/.docker/machine/machines/MACHINE-NAME"
	export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="MACHINE-NAME"
	# Run this command to configure your shell: 
	# eval $(docker-machine env MACHINE-NAME)

3.4 Configure shell to use your docker-machine
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
After this, when you execute "docker" command it will be executed remotely.

::

	$ eval $(docker-machine env MACHINE-NAME)

Now if you run "docker-machine ls" you see that your machine is active and
ready to use.
::

In this stage, this option is very restrictive and only in a well-justified
situation is allowed.
