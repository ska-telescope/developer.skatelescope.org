Feature Flags
=============

Feature flags are a way to control the behavior of the software. They are typically used to control the behavior of the software in development. They are also used to control the behavior of the software in production.

This guide provides SKAO software developers with the necessary information to understand, implement, and manage feature flags effectively within our ecosystem.

We primarily leverage GitLab's Feature Flags functionality, often paired with the Unleash Proxy for performance and scalability, especially in our Kubernetes-based deployments.
