Code Review
********************

SKA developers will require a code review following the creation of a merge request. 
Code reviews are checks that are carried out on the content of a merge request by another team member. Reviews are carried out by either a single or multple members to give impartial feedback on improvements to the content. 
The main advantages of Code Reviews are listed below.

* Ensures consistency in design and implementation
* Optimises code for better performance
* Encourages collaboration and sharing new techniques
* Monitoring project quality requirements
* Enhancing maintainability of the code

Code reviews happen at multiple stages of the development process and it is beneficial to have reviews throughout the development process.
This allows developers to add improvements on the go so they can avoid large changes at the end of their assignment. 

Duty of the Reviewer
====================

The duty of the reviewer is to address the following.

* Ensure best practices in coding standards are being upheld.
* Code coverage
* Identify typos or gramatical errors.
* Identify incorrect naming conventions.
* Suggest improvements to the code e.g. more suitable methods available.

Reviewing in Gitlab
====================

Gitlab is the tool we use to perform code reviews. The review is completed under the merge request section of the repository being changed.
The developer will usually request a review and link the merge request URL, but all open merge requests can also be viewed in Gitlab under "Review Requests".

1. On the Merge Request URL, select "Changes"
2. Comment on each file changed as required
3. Comment on specific lines by selecting the line and clicking the speech bubble. You can drag to select multiple lines. 
4. In the text area, write your first comment, then select Start a review below your comment.
5. Continue adding comments to lines of code. After each comment, select Add to review. Comments made as part of a review are visible only to you until you submit your review.
6. When your review is complete, you can submit the review. Your comments are now visible, and any quick actions included in your comments are performed.
