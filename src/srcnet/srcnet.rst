SRCNet Software Stack
=====================

This section details the software stack that underpins the SRCNet platform. 
The aim is to provide deployment and installation instructions for each of 
the services involved in the local functionality of SRCNet.
This software stack refers to the various software subsystems that work together 
to enable the functionality of SRCNet nodes. These subsystems can be broadly 
categorized into local mandatory services running on individual nodes, local optional services
that can be deployed on nodes, and global services that run centrally. 
The following sections detail the specific software components for each category. 
This includes Data Management Services, Data Parsing, Visualization Services and Tools, 
Interactive Analysis Interfaces and Monitoring Services.
